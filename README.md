# NNV-Geocoding
Initial commit

Geocoding and plotting A New Nation Votes Data Set as digitized by
Tufts University and the American Antiquarian Society.

Geocoded using Google’s Geocoding API.

Significantly influenced by Lincoln Mullen’s Digital History Methods in
R (http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/dh-r/index.html).

CSVs with latitude and longitude included for convenience.

NB: some of the locations are inaccurate due to historical name changes.
